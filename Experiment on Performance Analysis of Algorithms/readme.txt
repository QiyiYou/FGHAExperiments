main.m                      Implement the relevant algorithm experiments in "An Efficient Method for Solving a Class of Gauss Hypergeometric Functions in Wireless Communication", and compare the algorithm proposed FGHA in the paper with the algorithm built in Matlab
fastHypergeom.c             The source code of FGHA(Fast Gauss Hypergeometric function solving Algorithm) proposed in this paper is implemented.
fastHypergeom.mexw64        Mex files compiled according to fastHypergeom.c. (If the running environment does not support this file execution, run "mex fastHypergeom.c" to compile according to fastHypergeom.c)
